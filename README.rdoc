= Renum - Ruby Enumerations

Author: Cássio Marques - cassiommc at gmail

== Description

Ok, I know there are a lot of different solutions to this problem. But none of them solved my problem,
so here's Renum. I needed to build a Rails application around a legacy database and this database was
filled with those small, unchangeable tables used to create foreign key constraints everywhere. 

=== For example:

	 Table "public.relationshipstatus"
	Column     |     Type      | Modifiers 
	-------------+---------------+-----------
	 code        | character(1)  | not null
	 description | character(11) | 
	Indexes:
		"relationshipstatus_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (code)

	select * from relationshipstatus;
	code   |  description  
	-------+--------------
	1      | Single   
	2      | Married     
	3      | Widow
	4      | Divorced 


And then I had things like a people table with a 'relationship_status' column with a foreign key 
pointing to the relationshipstatus table.

While this is a good thing from the database normalization perspective, managing this values in
my tests was very hard. Doing database joins just to get the description of some value was absurd. 
And, more than this, referencing them in my code using magic numbers was terrible and meaningless: 
What's does it mean when we say that someone or something is '2'?

Enter Renun.

== Creating enumerations

Enumerations are created as models, but you can put then anywhere in your application. In Rails 
applications, I put them inside models/. 

  class RelationshipStatus < Renum::Base
    associate_values(
      :single   => [1, 'Single'],
      :married  => [2, 'Married'],
      :widow    => [3, 'Widow'],
      :divorced => [4, 'Divorced'],
    )
  end

This will create some nice stuff:

* Each enumeration's value will turn into a constant:

  RelationshipsStatus::SINGLE # returns 1
  RelationshipStatus::MARRIED # returns 2 and so on...

* You can retrieve a list with all the enumeration codes:

  RelationshipStatus.list # [1,2,3,4]

* You can get an array of options, ready to use with the 'select', 'select_tag', etc family of Rails helpers.

  RelationshipStatus.to_a # [["Divorced", 4],["Married", 2],["Single", 1],["Widow", 3]]

* You can manipulate the has used to create the enumeration:

  RelationshipStatus.enumeration # returns the exact hash used to define the enumeration

== Using enumerations

The cool part is that you can use these enumerations with any class, be it an ActiveRecord instance
or not.

  class Person
    include Renum
    attr_accessor :relationship_status

    has_enumeration_for :relationship_status, :with => RelationshipStatus
  end

This will create: 

* A humanized description for the values of the enumerated attribute:

		p = Person.new
		p.relationship_status = RelationshipStatus::DIVORCED
		p.relationsip_status_humanize # => 'Divorced'

* If your class can manage validations and responds to :validates_inclusion_of, it will create this
validation:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_enumeration_for :relationship_status, :with => RelationshipStatus
  end

  p = Person.new :relationship_status => 6 # => there is no '6' value in the enumeration
  p.valid? # => false
  p.errors[:relationship_status] # => "is not included in the list"

Remember that in Rails 3 you can add validations to any kind of class and not only to those derived from 
ActiveRecord::Base.

== Installation

  gem install renum

== Using with Rails

* Create an initializer with the following code:

  ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, Renum

* Add the 'rerum' gem as a dependency in your environment.rb (Rails 2.3.x) or Gemfile (if you're using Bundler)

== Why did you reinvent the wheel?

There are other similar solutions to the problem out there, but I could not find one that
worked both with strings and integers as the enumerations' codes. I had both situations in 
my legacy database. 

== Why defining enumerations outside the class that use it?

* I think it's cleaner.
* You can add behaviour to the enumeration class.
* You can reuse the enumeration inside other classes.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
